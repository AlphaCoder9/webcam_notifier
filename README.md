This project is about capturing image through your webcam and emailing it to you.
I used openCV library to detect the moment of the object. 
This is a small project to test and have a high level of feelings how
capturing images works. 
Same technique is used by state toll plazas they also use OCR but we 
are not going to work with that in this project. 

note: images are made up of pixels and each pixel has a dedicated number 
range from 0 to 255. openCV use BGR Blue,Green,Red
